# TO TEST ASSERTION: Rate of readmissions in trendiing down with increasing number of discharges#
#
# TRY: Looking for inverse (negative correlation) between #discharges and #readmissions
# 
# RESULTS: 
#   1) with #readmissions as a prectior of #discharges, significance with so-so R-squared with positive correlation
#   2) with #discharges as a predictor, significance with so-so R-squared with smaller positive correction

# Smaller hospitals/facilities may be lacking necessary resources to ensure quality care and prevent complications that lead to readmissions
# TODO find out what is separating lines
# TODO model dummy vars and interaction terms


# Setup an appropriate hypothesis test.
# H0 : there is no difference in excess readmission ratio between small and large hospitals
# HA : there is a significant difference in excess readmission ratio between small and large hospitals

# Compute and report the observed significance value (or p-value).
# Report statistical significance for Î± = .01.
