This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#library(broom) # used to neatly pass model results (model chaining/iteration)
#library(forecast) #consider using plot.ly for interactive forecast
library(plyr)
library(dummies)
library(nortest)
library(glmnet) # http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html
library(caret)
library(Amelia) # missing value viz
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
